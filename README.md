<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Check the NFT Marketplace Smart Contract deployed:
- [Rinkeby Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x3cb4F7C5f7e3355BEe1341251A8D8a2B04fBC7B7#code)

Check the BasicNFT Smart Contract deployed:
- [Rinkeby Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x81A6DE6E6389fcF0165774b3Eb13B6BDac5fb3dd#code)

All the code was developed for learning purposes and is from [Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript – 32-Hour Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&lis) by freeCodeCamp.org and Patrick Collins

The project represents a decentralized NFT marketplace with basic functionalities

It also includes a basic NFT contract to use in the NFT marketplace

It includes tests for the contracts and deployment functions for hardhat and real networks (ethereum, rinkeby, polygon...)

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

### Etherscan verification

This project also includes automatic verification of the contract for real networks. The verification is only executed when running on real networks

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can use this code it as a template to develop your own NFTs contract, there are many improvements that can be done so feel free to make any change.

This repo can also be used to learn about testing Smart Contract on hardhat, there are some tests written to understand the basics but you can write new one or redesign mines to fit you. 

You can also use it to deploy your own raffle smart contract to a Solidity supported Blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC...).

**Note: This project is a demo and I don't recommend using it without changes, there are many things that can be improved so take in consideration before using it.**
